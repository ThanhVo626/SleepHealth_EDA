# SleepHealth_EDA
This project is about how your lifestyle influences your sleep health.

## Occupation and Exercise
### Kaylee Paterson
This section of the project looks at how occupation, physical activity level, and daily steps affect sleep quality and sleep duration.


## Age and Gender as it relates to Sleep Duration and Quality of Sleep
### Lois Stetson
The present analysis examines the relationship between average age, gender, sleep duration, and the overall quality of sleep among both males and females. Throughout this investigation, we seek to understand how age impacts sleep quality and duration, and whether it plays a significant role in influencing these factors.
